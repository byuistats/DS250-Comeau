> We need skills not grades!  [Shifting Attention](https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/blog-all/2018/8/1/retiring-the-red-pen-shifting-attention-from-grades-to-learning)

### Competency scale {#scale}

You must complete all competency items at the level detailed to achieve the listed grade. You can request half-step adjustments if you fall slightly short or over on some elements.

You will need to provide a detailed description in your _request and review_ letter of the items you completed to support your grade request.  If a student was in the B range they might write the following;

> I got three fives, one four, and two threes for 29 points on the projects. I met the checkpoint requirements with 4 full mark mid-project checkpoints and 4 methods and calculation checkpoints. I regularly attended data science society.  I believe my coding challenge will be above a 3.  I request a _B+_.

### Competency elements {#elements}


{{% tabs %}}

    {{% tab "Projects" %}}

#### Projects (Grand questions)

_Each of the seven projects is worth 5 points and you get one additional submission after the due date. There are 5 two-week projects and two one-week projects to start and end the class._

##### Grading Details

* **1 point:**  Submission
* **3 points:** submission of a good faith attempt with a statement of work quality.
* **4 points:** High-quality work that addresses each of the _Grand Questions_ and a statement of work quality.
* **5 points:** Addressed reviewer issues and completion of resubmission if needed.

    {{% /tab %}}

    {{% tab "Checkpoints methods" %}}

#### Checkpoints (methods and calculations)

_These checkpoints are in Canvas and they open when the project starts.  They have unlimited attempts and remain open until the end of the semester._

##### Examples

* **Fact-Finding Questions (Calculate descriptive summaries):**  Fact-finding questions help you with calculations that build into the _Grand Questions_ of the project.  These questions have clearly defined answers using Python calculations.  You should expect 2-3 problems.

1. Example: Using the top 10 airports in size, what is the average size?
2. Example: What proportion of flights are delayed at the largest airport?

* **How the code works questions (Explaining the tools):**  This part could have direct answer questions or open-ended questions.  

1. Example (direct):  What is the recommended function for arranging your data by a variable? What are the outputs after using `<FUNCTION>`?
2. Example (open): Your client has shown some confusion about NumPy's 'nan' handling in Python. Help them understand by answering the question, 'How is missing data handled in Pandas?'

    {{% tab "Checkpoints mid-project" %}}

#### Checkpoints (Mid-project status)

_The mid-project checkpoint has a few questions.  It opens the first day of the project and closes at 1 am on the 3rd day of class for the project. It has the following questions._

##### Examples

1. Have you checked off more than one grand question from the current project?  (Yes/No)
2. Have you spent at least 2 hours using code to tackle problems related to the case study? (Yes/No).
3. Have you prepared questions you have about the case study to ask in your next meeting? (Yes/No).

    {{% /tab %}}

    {{% tab "DS community" %}}

#### Data science community

To earn credit for the DS Community element you must complete two different tasks from the list below. At the end of the semester, you will be asked to report on which tasks you completed and what you learned from them.

-  Attend [Data Science Society](https://byuidatascience.github.io/society/) at least once.
- Sign up for an email newsletter that will teach you more about data science. [Data Science Weekly](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/) or [Data Elixir](https://dataelixir.com/) are good options.
- Listen to a podcast episode about data science. [Build a Career in Data Science](https://podcast.bestbook.cool/) has some excellent episodes.
- Watch a professional presentation on YouTube about data science. Be prepared to share the link and a summary of the video.
- Reach out to someone who works in a data-related field and ask them for 15 minutes of their time. Use this time to conduct an "[informational interview](https://brightspotcdn.byu.edu/54/b6/2554ebb842fab54640a15ff0afb3/informational-interview.pdf)" and learn more about their responsibilities and career path.
- Research and apply to at least 5 data-related jobs or internships.

#### Finishing the semester

Submit a _request and review_ letter that includes what you have learned from this class, the next data science course you plan on taking, and the final grade that you are requesting based on the work you have submitted.

    {{% /tab %}}

    {{% tab "Challenge" %}}

#### Coding challenge

We will have an in-class coding challenge on the ultimate or penultimate day of class. It would be best if you did not view this challenge like a traditional exam.  It will cover the general techniques that we have been practicing throughout the course.

We expect to have a few practice challenges throughout the semester. We will score the coding challenge on a four-point scale.

- **1 point:** At least you tried.
- **2 points:** You have learned some items from the course, but your work in the coding challenge is deficient.
- **3 points:** Your submission uses proper coding techniques and addresses the objective.
- **4 points:** Exceptional work.  Your code can be used as a solution to share with others.

[^2]: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1612/1612.07140.pdf. You will see this pattern in DS 350, DS 460, and Math 488.  It will progressively get more realistic. 
[^3]: We do expect that this is not your first experience with Python and VS Code.  If you have done other programming courses, you should be able to succeed in this course. If you have any questions, please ask.
[^4]: Making the right checklists can be difficult.  Bad checklists could fall in the following categories -- vague and imprecise; too long; hard to use; impractical; too pedantic. Useful checklists are precise, efficient, easy to use and understand. This is the first time this course has been offered, so we will have to work together to ensure the requirements are reasonable.
