## Methods Checkpoint

All the answers will be in the assigned reading or in these slides.

## Notes on Project 0

#### Installing Packages and Extensions

Learn how to install packages by reading the assigned material and by watching the video tutorial on [this page](https://byuistats.github.io/DS250-Comeau/course-materials/python-for-data-science/).

The readings mention a lot of different packages. For Project 0, you need to install at least `pandas`, `altair`, `numpy`, `tabulate`, and `jupyter`.

The readings will also mention two VS Code extensions you need to install.

#### Jupyter Notebooks vs. Interactive Python Window

Should you decide to use Juypyter Notebooks this semester within VS Code, [this is a great guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) to get you started. 

Or you can choose to stick with the [Python Interactive window](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py) like the textbook does.

#### Use Your Resources!

- Technical documentation
- Google searches
- Asking for help on Slack
- Don't forget the [data science lab](https://byuidatascience.github.io/lab.html)! (Starts next week.)
- Question that cannot be answered by the textbook and documentation? Google it.
- A function you have never seen before? Google it.
- An error in your code? Google it.

#### Markdown

##### What is Markdown?  
- A clean, human readable way to make slick html and pdf documents
- Used widely among programmers for clean documentation 
- Used widely by Data Scientists to publish results and communicate with stakeholders

[Here's a good summary](https://byuistats.github.io/DS250-Comeau/course-materials/markdown/)

#### Quarto

Do all your tinkering in interactive Python or Jupyter notebooks, report finished code, graphs, etc. in Quatro

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/)


## Now for some data!

#### Let's get this party started

#### Your turn:

1. Read in the cars data set
1. Work with you your teams to talk through interesting possibilities for a graph
1. Work on Project 0 Questions and Tasks

## Project 0

#### VS Code and Python

#### Packages (Libraries?)

#### Jupyter Notebooks

I'll be using Juypyter Notebooks this semester within VS Code. [This is a great guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) to get you started. 

Or you can choose to stick with the [Python Interactive window](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py) like the textbook does.

#### Let's make a chart!

#### Creating a report.

## Finishing some setup

{{< faq "Any issues with getting Python installed?">}}

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Altair in VS Code](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/display_frontends.html)

{{</ faq >}}


{{< faq "Does everyone have `pandas`, `altiar`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn` installed?">}}

- [Video tutorial: how to install packages.](../../course-materials/python-for-data-science/)

One way to install packages:

```
pip install pandas altair
```
Maybe a better way to do it: run this in an interactive window.

```
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install pandas altair
```

{{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "Does everyone have `altair-saver` working?">}}

- [altair_saver](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair_saver)
- [Video tutorial](../../course-materials/altiar/)

---------------------------------------------------->





<!--------------------
{{< faq "Why are we using Altair?">}}

## It is built on the VEGA and D3 which are fast and web based.

{{< faq "What are we not learning in this course?">}}

## Indexing, `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]`

I may not be experienced enough to understand why I should teach you these. I think they all add complexity to what we are learning in the course and we have elected to avoid it.  We will use `reset_index()` a lot.  I think [MultiIndex](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-multiindex-in-pandas-to-level-up-your-analysis-aeac7f451fce) features create complication. I have also elected to use `.filter()` instead of `.loc[]` because I like it.

## Virtual Environments

[Virtual Environments](https://towardsdatascience.com/virtual-environments-for-data-science-running-python-and-jupyter-with-pipenv-c6cb6c44a405#:~:text=The%20primary%20purpose%20of%20Python,dependencies%20every%20other%20project%20has.) appear to be an important tool as you continue to use Python.  We will not be teaching these or supporting these in our course.

## matplotlib (and any tool leveraging it)

It feels old, [has a bad api](https://ryxcommar.com/2020/04/11/why-you-hate-matplotlib/), and isn't declarative.

## Coming Up:

#### Can we practice making a chart in Altair with VS Code?


{{< faq "What can Python Interactive do?">}}

## Let's review the power of [Python Interactive](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py)

- `# %%` in my `.py` script is much better than Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`). 
  - If we hope to have our code work in a production environment then Jupyter is problematic.
  - Caching and code chunks are problematic

{{< faq "Set-up your `py` script">}}

## Setting up your script

A good data science `.py` script will have packages and data loaded at the top. Usually you have a few short commented sentences that descibe the script purpose.

   ```python
   # %%
   # import pandas, altair, numpy
   import pandas as pd
   import altair as alt
   import numpy as np

   # %%
   # load data
   # handgrenade data https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4soils/blob/master/data-raw/cfbp_handgrenade/cfbp_handgrenade.csv
   
   url = 'https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4soils/raw/master/data-raw/cfbp_handgrenade/cfbp_handgrenade.csv'
   
   dat = pd.read_csv(url)

   ```

{{< faq "Make a scatter plot with `hmx` on the x and `rdx` on the y">}}

To get you started: 

```python
alt.Chart(dat).encode()
```

{{</ faq >}}


{{< faq "Make a spatial plot with `hmx` colored">}}

1. Encode the `row` and `column` to the axes.
2. Color the `hmx` points using the 'goldorange' color scheme.
3. Use `mark_square()` and make the square sizes 500.

{{</ faq >}}


-------------------->




<!-----------------
alt.Chart(dat).encode(x='hmx', y='rdx').mark_circle()

(alt.
  Chart(dat).
  encode(
    x='column', 
    y='row', 
    size=alt.value(500),
    color=alt.Color('hmx', scale=alt.Scale(scheme='goldorange'))).
  mark_square()
)
----------------->





<!----------------------
{{< faq "Create a histogram of `hmx`">}}

1. Encode the x-axis as binned.
2. Encode the y-axis as counts.
3. Configure the title to a `fontSize` of 20.
4. Use properties to place the title.

<!-------------
{{< faq "How can I get help?">}}

- Make sure you __read the reading assignments__ once or twice or five times.
- Read the guides on the [Course Materials](../../../course-materials/) page.
- Post questions in our #cse250_s21_larson slack channel (and try to help others!)
- Attend the [Data Science Lab](https://byuidatascience.github.io/lab.html).
- Google is your best friend.
