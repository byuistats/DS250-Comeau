## Welcome to class!

#### Announcements
1. Project 3 - Getting pickier about good communication
    * Career batting average
    * Meaningful report name (Drop "Client Report")
    * Meaningful section headers so the table of contents is useful (don't call them "Grand Questions")
    * Don't include "My useless chart" from the template
2. Coding Challenge - Table
3. Ask for help!
    * Computing lab
    * Computing lab Slack channel (search)
    * Slack classmates or general channel 

#### Spiritual Thought

##### What did you learn about the Sermon on the Mount?
##### What does it mean to be the light of the world? 

<br>
<br>


<!--
##### Are facts true?  

- How do you distinguish between truth and error?
- Joshua and Caleb

<br>

- What is your testimony built on?
- How do you receive answers from the Holy Ghost?

<br>
-->

## Pictionary!

From [Sebastian Thrun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJixNvx9BAc):
> AI is able to learn 'rules' from highly repetitive data.

> The single most important thing for AI to accomplish in the next ten years is to free us from the burden of repetitive work.

## Your Turn: Student Classification Problem

Can we predict if a student is from Utah?

<br>

## Your Turn: Features and Targets 

Import [dwellings.csv](https://byuistats.github.io/DS250-Comeau/projects/project-4/). With a neighbor:

1. **Try to describe the data.** Explain what each observation (row) is and what measurements we have on that observation (columns).
2. **Now try describing the modeling (machine learning) we are going to do in terms of "features" and "targets".** Watch out - are there any columns that are the target in disguise? (You may need to review the [project goal](../../projects/project-4).)
3. **What features do you expect to have a strong relationship with the target?**

## Before Next Class

[**Machine Learning Introduction**](https://byuistats.github.io/CSE250-Larson/course-materials/machine-learning/)

- Step-by-step guide (mostly) for training a GaussianNB classifier. (The steps will be the same for any algorithm you use.) 

[**Visual Introduction to Machine Learning**](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)

1. Machine learning identifies patterns using statistical learning and computers by unearthing boundaries in data sets. You can use it to make predictions.
2. One method for making predictions is called a decision trees, which uses a series of if-then statements to identify boundaries and define patterns in the data.
3. Overfitting happens when some boundaries are based on distinctions that don't make a difference. You can see if a model overfits by having test data flow through the model.

{{< faq "Start working on Question 1">}}

The goal of Grand Question 1 is to help us with "feature selection".

- Remember: Overfitting happens when some boundaries are based on on _distinctions that don't make a difference_.
- More data does not always lead to better models. ([Occam's Razor](https://www.google.com/search?q=Occam%E2%80%99s+Razor&rlz=1C1GCEJ_enUS882US882&oq=Occam%E2%80%99s+Razor&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8))

Common questions:

[MaxRowsError: How can I plot Large Datasets?](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/faq.html#maxrowserror-how-can-i-plot-large-datasets)

You may also save data to a local filesystem and reference the data by file path. Altair has a JSON data transformer that will do this transparently when enabled:

```python
alt.data_transformers.disable_max_rows()
subset_data = denver.sample(n = 4999)
```

#### [Bias-Variance Tradeoff](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-2/)

> 1. Models approximate real-life situations using limited data.
> 2. In doing so, errors can arise due to assumptions that are overly simple (bias) or overly complex (variance).
> 3. Building models is about making sure there's a balance between the two.

#### But what is the 'Pavlovian bell' in the machine learning model?

![](../../images/ml/test.png)

Some mathematical penalty/reward equation.

## Using our project data to understand features, targets, and samples.

> 1. Import `dwellings_ml.csv` and write a short sentence describing your data. Remember to explain an observation and what measurements we have on that observation.
> 2. Now try describing the modeling (machine learning) we are going to do in terms of features and targets.
>    A. Are there any columns that are the target in disguise?
>    B. _Are the observational units unique in every row?_

### If your model is near perfect in its predictability, you might be cheating.

### Watch out for [transactional data](http://localhost:1313/CSE250-Course/images/ml/iris_description.png)!
