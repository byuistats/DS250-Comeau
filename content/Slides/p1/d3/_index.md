## Welcome to class!

<br>

#### Reminder about resources

- "Potluck" prep assignment
- Work with peers
- Make your own cheat sheet

#### Anouncements

1. Resume Workshop:  5:00-6:00 Tonight (Wed 1/18) STC 375
2. Always submit a halfway checkpoint even if you're behind!
    * It's the only hard due date
    * Think of it as a check in with "the boss"

##### Thoughts on P1 Halfway Checkpoint

1. Do your work in .py or .ipynb file, write-up in .qmd
2. Making/submitting a video:  [Loom](https://www.loom.com/)
3. ~~alt.Save()~~ Quarto


<br>

## Let's practice!

**Explore the data**

```python

import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

url = "https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv"
names = pd.read_csv('names_year.csv')

names.head()
names.describe()

```

**What do you want the chart to look like?**

**What types of charts are there?**

```python
alt.Chart()
   .mark_*()
   .encode()

# alt.Chart().encode()
   
```

<br>

**What data do you need to make that chart?**

```python
# names[['name'],['year']] vs. names.query()

kobe = names.query("name == 'Kobe'")[["name", "year", "Total"]]
kobe2 = names.query("name == 'Kobe'").filter(items=["name", "year", "Total"])

# method chaining with ()

```

**What can you add to your chart to help tell a story?**

{{< faq "Can you modify your previous chart to include your birth state?">}}

- Can you include `Total` and your birth state?
- Is there a better metric than raw counts that you could calculate?
- Are there good labels that you could include on the chart ([`mark_text()`](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/bar_chart_with_labels.html#gallery-bar-chart-with-labels))?

Remember this advice [from Edward Tufte](https://medium.com/@AnyChart/advices-by-edward-tufte-importance-of-context-for-charts-819396300255).

> To be truthful and revealing, data graphics must bear on the question at the heart of quantitative thinking: "Compared to what?" The emaciated, data-thin design should always provoke suspicion, for graphics often lie by omission, leaving out data sufficient for comparisons.

{{< faq "Use the `query()` method and `filter()` method to get your name and years in the rows with and include the `name`, `year`, and `Total` columns">}}

1. filter the data down to your names (`query`)
2. select the pertinent columns (`filter()`)
3. Create a new data object for your name.

{{< faq "Create a line chart with your name.">}}

```python
base = (alt.Chart()
    .encode(
        x = alt.X(''),
        y = alt.Y('')
    )
    .mark_line()
)
```

Just use your state count or the `Total` count for your name.
