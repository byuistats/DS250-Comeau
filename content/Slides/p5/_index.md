A significant portion of a data scientist's job is data cleaning.  during these two weeks we will not hide the data munging from you.  We will practice data cleaning using a Star Wars survey from FiveThirtEight. Survey data is notoriously difficult to handle.  Even when the data is recorded cleanly the options for ‘write in questions’, ‘choose from multiple answers’, ‘pick all that are right’, and ‘multiple choice questions’ makes storing the data in a tidy format difficult.
