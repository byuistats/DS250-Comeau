GitHub is the communication tool for Data Scientists and developers.  As students, you will want to curate your creative work on GitHub using Git. GitHub is the place to share your original work, not your homework assignments.  Many people store their personal websites, blogs, and project websites on GitHub.  Our textbook and course are hosted on GitHub, and you can see [J. Hathaway's](http://jhathaway.io/) or [Ryan Hafen's](https://ryanhafen.com/) personal Data Science websites that are hosted on GitHub as well.  You will be making your public resume that will be hosted on GitHub for this project.

In the process of this project, we will be learning the process of Git and the tools of GitHub.  We will use the Git process to have others in our class to edit our resumes.  Take the process seriously (pick a suitable username and write a good resume), and you will have the beginning of your social presence in the DS/CS space.
