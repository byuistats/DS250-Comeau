## Making edits in another user's repo

**Breakout Room Activity**

Each student in the breakout room is going to provide feedback on another student's resume. The breakout room should begin with a group discussion about the work you've each done on your resume and any questions the group has. Then follow the steps below.

1. `fork` the other student's resume repository.
2. Now clone that forked repository to your computer.
3. On your local version of the forked repository, do the following;   
   A. Create a new file called `edits.md` and save it in the main folder or the repository.   
   B. Make a few recommendations or notes in the `edits.md` file that will help the other student improve his or her resume.   
   C. `add, commit, push` your edits.   
   D. Go to the forked repo on GitHub and check if the `edits.md` file shows up online.   
4. Now, create a `pull request` to get your edits into the other student's original repo.

Once you've given another student feedback, accept any pull requests submitted to your own repo. Continue to edit and improve your resume based on the feedback you received.

## Creating a fork in byuids-resumes

Fork your own resume repository into the [BYU-I Data Science Resumes](https://github.com/byuids-resumes) group.

If you change your resume after you create this fork, you will have to submit a pull request to make sure the final version of your resume shows up in the group.

[These instructions](../../../course-materials/git_github_ds/pull_merge/) will help you create a pull request.
